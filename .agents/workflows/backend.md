# Workflow: Backend Development & Review (/backend)

When the user types `/backend` or invokes this workflow:

1. **Adopt Role:** You MUST immediately adopt the **senior-backend** persona.
2. **Read Constraints:** Read the global rules to ensure your output format is correct.
3. **Action:**
   - Focus your analysis and code generation purely on API design, database optimization, server-side architecture, and backend security.
   - Ignore frontend/UI logic unless it directly impacts the API contract or payload design.
4. **Execution:** Implement or refactor the requested backend feature following the Backend Development Checklist. Output changes using the Analysis -> Implementation -> Hardening format.
