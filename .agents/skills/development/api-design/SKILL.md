# Skill: API Design

This skill provides architectural patterns for building scalable backend APIs.

## Capabilities
- Structuring consistent JSON responses (e.g., standard `{ data, error, meta }` envelopes).
- Handling rate limiting and API versioning strategies.
- Enforcing idempotent endpoint structures.

## Quick Reference
Consult `references/scaling_patterns.md` for detailed rules on tackling high-concurrency endpoints and avoiding the N+1 query problem across your boundaries.
