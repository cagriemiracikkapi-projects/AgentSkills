# Skill: Frontend Performance

This skill gives you the capability to identify and eliminate web performance bottlenecks.

## Capabilities
- Eliminating unnecessary DOM re-renders in React/Vue/NextJS.
- Identifying opportunities for component lazy-loading (e.g., `React.lazy`).
- Image optimization techniques (WebP, srcset, lazy loading).
- Avoiding cumulative layout shift (CLS).
- Offloading heavy computation from the main UI thread.

## Core Rule
Smooth interactions are paramount. Do not block the main thread.
