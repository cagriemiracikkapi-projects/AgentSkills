# Skill: Security & Code Review

Capabilities required to rigorously audit and refactor code without compromising systemic integrity.

## Capabilities
- Identifying code smells (Deep nesting, God functions, Magic Numbers).
- Security auditing based on OWASP Top 10 guidelines.
- Flagging unclosed network connections or loose database handles.
- Creating detailed Audit Checklists for priority.

## Core Rule
Prioritize fixes based on risk (Critical vs Low). Read context carefully to avoid breaking decoupled logic flows.
