# Skill: QA Testing & Test Automation

This skill embodies a robust, test-driven approach to coding. Let a QA mindset drive the development.

## Capabilities
- Generating comprehensive unit test suites (Jest, NUnit, PyTest, XCTest).
- Testing system resilience under edge-case conditions (Nulls, API timeouts, invalid payloads).
- Implementing complete Isolation by mocking all external dependencies and databases.
- Given-When-Then (Arrange, Act, Assert) readable test structures.

## Core Rule
Do not write tests simply for lines of coverage. Cover business-critical paths and failure states. Verify mock teardowns prevent state leakage.
